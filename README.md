## Hide Vine Items
The hideVineItems.user.js script creates a hide item link on Amazon Vine pages. Hidden items are stored by ASIN in the browser. No interaction with any server occurs. Hidden items are still counted in the results for the page, so this does not change the number of pages of results. This script was developed for ViolentMonkey, but may work with other userscript extensions.
